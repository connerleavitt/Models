# Scratch_Models
Models and Algorithms are basically a family of functions and or calculations working together to produce a final result. The right combination of functions and calculations are what make up these "Black Box's" in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The goal of this repository is to pull back the curtain on these "black boxes" by diving into the math and coding the models from scatch. By doing so I hope to not only deepen my understanding of how these algorithms work part by part, but have the ability to adapt and tweak these models for my data needs. I like to view these models as functioning templates, but once all their mechanisms are understood the better I will be at tuning hyperparameters and customizing these models to my data problems. 


I may get lazy with the math and upload images from the web in place of writing out the functions in laytex so please excuse my laziness. 

Learning is an endless pursuit and I hope this pursuit will bring me a few steps closer to complete understanding and mastery of these subjects. So, with that being said I will look to other sources for inspiration, and I will do my best to give credit where credit is due.
